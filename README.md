🎮 Wordle Game – Full Stack MERN App
A full-stack, responsive Wordle-inspired word guessing game built with the MERN stack. This project features secure authentication, persistent game state, and a dynamic difficulty system.
🔗 Quick Links
•	Live App: Wordle Live Demo
•	GitHub Repository: Source Code
 
🚀 Key Features
•	Custom Difficulty: Choose your word length (3–6 letters) and difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard).
•	Secure Auth: Full integration with Google OAuth 2.0 for a seamless sign-in experience, with a guest mode fallback.
•	Persistent Progress: Track your game history and scores stored securely in the cloud.
•	Dynamic UI: Interactive feedback with color-coded guesses (Green/Yellow/Grey).
•	Production-Ready: Fully deployed and optimized for performance on Vercel.
 
🏗 Architectural Overview
The application follows a structured MERN architecture, separating concerns for scalability and security:
•	Backend: Node.js & Express.js managing API endpoints and middleware.
•	Frontend: Vanilla JS, HTML5, and CSS3 for a lightweight, high-performance interface.
•	Database: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud) for storing user profiles and game history.
•	Security: JWT-based authentication combined with Google OAuth for protected route access.
 
🛠 Local Development Setup
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/bcdfgi/Wordle.git
cd Wordle
npm install express dotenv
3. Environment Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following keys:
Code snippet
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
4. Running the Server
Start the development environment:
Bash
node server.js
 
🧠 Game Logic & Rules
After each guess, the game processes the input against the secret word:
•	🟩 Green: Correct letter & correct position.
•	🟨 Yellow: Correct letter, wrong position.
•	⬜ Grey: Letter not in word.
Difficulty Scaling:
•	Easy: 6 chances
•	Medium: 4 chances
•	Hard: 3 chances
 
📈 What I Learned
•	Authentication: Mastering OAuth flows and managing session state in a stateless backend.
•	Database Design: Implementing Mongoose schemas for complex user-game relationships.
•	Deployment: Debugging and optimizing full-stack deployments on Vercel.
•	Security: Protecting sensitive API routes using JWT middleware.
 
🔮 Future Improvements
•	Global Leaderboard: Implement a real-time ranking system.
•	Daily Challenge Mode: A shared daily word for all users.
•	Multiplayer Support: Head-to-head word guessing.
